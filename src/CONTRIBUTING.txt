Pull requests will be handled in the following order and time periods:

Change Requested		Has Unit Tests		Est Time Period
================		==============		===============
Bug fix				YES			hours to a few days
Bug fix				NO			a few days to a week
feature from backlog		YES			a few days to a week
feature from backlog		NO			days to weeks
enhancement not on backlog	YES			a few days to a week
enhancement not on backlog	NO			weeks
feature not on backlog		YES			weeks
feature not on backlog		NO			months to never

The queue is fastest / simplest pull request with accompanying unit tests will always receive attention first and preempt slower / complicated pull requests.

An enhancement is either a small tweak or minor change (typically doesn't spawn new files).  Features are more grandiose in design.
